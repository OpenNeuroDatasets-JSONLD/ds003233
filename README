This dataset contains data from 20 'student' and 5 'expert' participants. Students enrolled in an introduction to computer science course underwent six fMRI scanning sessions throughout the course. During the first five sessions, students were shown course lecture videos. On the final session, students were shown five recaps with highlights from previous weeks. In addition, participants were given a self-paced final exam in which they were asked to give verbal responses to visually presented questions. Experts underwent the final scan only.	

At the beginning and end of each task, we appended 20-30 seconds of unrelated “filler” audiovisual clips (from YouTube “oddly satisfying” compilations, featuring, for example, objects being assembled neatly). The corresponding TRs were trimmed and are not included in the data.

T1 scans were obtained in every session. High definition T1 scans were obtained on ses-wk2 (students) and ses-wk6 (experts).
			
Behavioral data about the final exam is provided in the 'sourcedata' folder. Response onset/offset information is provided in exam_timing.tsv. Exam scores are provided in exam_scores.tsv.
